## Holidaze - Project exam 2

## Installation
To install the application, download all the contents from this repo.
Once it's downloaded, cd into the folder using your cli (Terminal on Mac). 
Run the code "npm install" to install all the required packages from the package.json file.
Once that has installed, run the code "npm start" to launch the app in local development mode. 


## Setup PHP and Json
To get the application to work, the hotel-api folder must be added to the htdocs folder in a local server like XAMPP.
This folder contains the JSON files that the app reads and writes to, and the PHP documents that makes this possible.

## Make the Json-files read- and writeable
The Json files must be made read- and writeable. 
This can be done by right clicking on the json-documents and choose show info. 
Here you will find a section regarding reading, writing and sharing rights. 
Make sure that it's NOT set to "read only". It has to be set to "read and write" for the files to work
