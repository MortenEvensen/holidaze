## Holidaze - Project exam 2

## Installation
To install the application, download all the contents from this repo.
Once it's downloaded, cd into the folder using your cli (Terminal on Mac). 
Run the code "npm install" to install all the required packages from the package.json file.
Once that has installed, run the code "npm start" to launch the app in local development mode. 


## Setup PHP and Json
To get the application to work, the hotel-api folder must be added to the htdocs folder in a local server like XAMPP.
This folder contains the JSON files that the app reads and writes to, and the PHP documents that makes this possible.
